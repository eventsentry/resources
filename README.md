[MSS-legacy.adml] (MSS-legacy.adml) and [MSS-legacy.admx] (MSS-legacy.admx): These are the MSS (Legacy) GPOs from MS. Since MS deleted most of their link to them but still needed for several compliance like STIG, we made them available here. Also can be downloaded from [Internet Archive] (https://Archive.org) at [This Link] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200723045549/https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/10/MSS-legacy.zip)
